## Code and theory

This workshop is a hands-on introduction to modern computer vision in R.
You’ll work through code examples and practical exercises.
Theory will be covered only to the extent needed to understand the key ideas and statistical foundations behind the models.

::: {.callout-warning}

## Reproducibility

Computer vision models can be only partly reproducible due to GPU computation.
Don’t be surprised if your results differ from those shown in the materials.

## Expectation

**How confident should I be coming into this workshop?**

. . .

You are good to go! 

There will be some new concepts and terminology, but nearly everything can be explained in statistical terms. Don’t be intimidated by CV jargon.
